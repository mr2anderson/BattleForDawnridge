# Send and receive ports must be different in any case.
# Client and local server ports must be different in any case too.
# Server ports must be different from client ports in case there will be two Battle for Dawnridge copies executed on one PC (a copy for a client and another copy for a server)
# Non-compliance with rules will lead to UB.
# It is recommended to use non-standard values to avoid situations where the port is controlled by another program.
# Correct operation of the server and client IS NOT GUARANTEED if the port used by their side is busy.
